# Telegram Daily Bot
## Description
You are looking at our _final project_ for a course that we have in university. This **_bot_** serves as daily digital newspaper, it gives you quick summary of all the
information you need when you wake up, like: current time, today weather, exchange rates, list of some today's news and so on.

### Why telegram?
We decided to choose telegram as our platform, because nowadays it's **_№1 messenger_** in our region and **_№2 news source_**, going right after Instagram.

### Main library  
As main lib we used **_aiogram_**, it's the most popular library for making any telegram bot's and it's has the most functionality throughout the rest of the libraries. 

## Data base

We used **_sqlite_** database, yes it maybe not the most functional one, but for our project it's has more than enough functions.

# How to install and run
Just install whole projects files, after, download all the libs from `requirements.txt`, then run `Aiobot.py` and bot is booted.
